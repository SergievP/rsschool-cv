## About Me
My goal is to make people's lives better with the help of IT technologies. I am convinced that technology saves time and energy so that we can spend more time with family and friends. At my previous job at a school as a teacher-organizer, I tried to learn from the experience of senior colleagues and use software tools for presentations, reports, and so on. The symbiosis of creativity and exact sciences is what attracts me to web-development.

  if( digit > 255 ){ return "FF"; }
